 * MIDDLEWARE
 * A middleware works as a request interceptor. It can manipulate the data that comes from the API or the data that is return
 * It returns next, so the next middleware can run (in this get the next middleware is the .get, .post, .put, .whatever method)
 * The middleware below gets the method from the API, transforms it to uppercase and also prints the URL that was called. Lastly, it calls
 * the next middleware.
 * I can also omit the app.use(middlewareName) and call it directly from the .get method, for example.
 * The syntax would look something lime app.get("/projects", middleWareName, (request, response) => {})
