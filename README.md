# goStack Bootcamp - by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/)

This is the repository that holds all content from Rocketseat's goStack Bootcamp.

The goStack Bootcamp is a full hands-on experience course focused on the MERN stack. Throughout the Bootcamp we have developed from scratch, a full stack application called goBarber.

goBarber is an application where barbers can offer their services to the public and clients can schedule appoints with their favorite barbers.

During the course we are also faced with a few challenges/exercises that we have to resolve on our own. These challenges are there to help us getting the content sticked in our heads and practice the content we learnt during a particular module.

**_Practicing is the key!_**

Enough talking... Below are the links to the goBarber application and to the resolution of all challenges.

# Challenges

## NodeJs Concepts

In this challenge I had to create an application to store github repositories. The application should allow for creating, listing, updating and removing repositories. Besides that, the user also should be able to like an repository.

## ReactJS Concepts

In this challenge I had to create the front-end application for the previous challenges.

## React-Native Concepts

For this challenge I had to create a mobile interface that connects to the API from the first challenge.

## NodeJS Fundaments

For this challenge I had the develop the back-end of an application called goFinance. The application should allow the user to create and list financial transactions. This challenge is the base API for the next two challenges.

## Database TypeORM File Upload

In this challenge I practiced what I learned with TypeORM and Multer. The application is an upgrade from the previous challenge as it now should add the transactions to a database as well as creating transactions based on a .csv file.

## goFinance Web - ReactJS

For this challenge I had to create the web version for the goFinance application that connects to the API developed in the two previous challenges.

## React-Native Fundaments

In this challenge I created a new app called GoMarketplace. The goal here was to create an application that mimics an online store shopping cart to practice routing, Async Storage and Context API.

## Database Relationship in NodeJS

The goal of this challenge was to make us practice database relationships with Typescript and TypeORM, including many to many relationships.
The application was the back-end that should allow users to create clients, products and orders through an RESTful API.

### goRestaurant Web - ReactJS

For this challenge I had to create an React application called goRestaurant. It's an application that simulates a restaurant (pretty similar to Uber Eats), and the goal was to practice the CRUD operations.

### goRestaurant Mobile - React-Native

In this challenge we create a similar application from the previous challenge, but this time using React-Native. The user should be able to filter dishes by names and/or food categories.
